        <h1>What I Wish for Us</h1>
        <p>I wish to explore various aspects of life with you, hopefully all of them. I hope to build a future with you, hope to walk all the stage of life with you. I want you you and I want it to be you. From the moment you walked into my life, everything changed. I want you to know how deeply I cherish you, how much you mean to me, and how profoundly I hope for a future with you. I dream of us standing side by side, building our dreams together, lifting each other up through every success and cheering for each other as we grow in our careers. I imagine the warmth of your hand in mine as we walk through life’s challenges, knowing that no matter how tough things get, we’ll face them together, one step at a time. The thought of enduring the trials of long distance doesn’t scare me, because loving you is worth every kilometer and every moment spent apart. It only makes me love you harder and fight for you even more. I promise to give you all the love my heart can hold, to be your anchor when the world feels uncertain, and to celebrate you endlessly. With you, I believe in the beauty of what’s ahead, because every vision of the future is brighter with you in it.. I dream of countless adventures with you, from exploring new places to building a cozy life filled with laughter and love. The future I see is radiant because you are at the heart of it. So please stay with me?</p>
