        <h1>How We Met</h1>
        <p>It was a day that I’ll never forget—the moment our paths crossed was like a beautiful twist of fate. I was a guy who was giving up on trying to find anyone through Hinge, and behold.. I matched with you. August 29th. I'll never forget. When we started talking through texts, then calls, then slowly they increased. I still remember our first video call, you were drunk and so beautiful. you took my breath away as I first laid my eyes on you on the video call. .The first date that we had was mesmerizing. It was also the first date I went on. I still remember the first time I saw you across the station, i noticed you first and i was in a hurry to crossover, wishing if I could just jump over the tracks. When I finally crossed over adn was up the stairs of the subway, I saw you and you were loooking at me as I was searching for you, smiling. That smile.. I knew that smile is somethingt that's gonna be the death of me. that smile is something I would want to protect and see everyday. Cursing my luck for the long-distance, I finally moved in for a hug as I saw you coming towards me. That first hug, I knew you were the perfect fit for me. the first 2 seconds of the hug was formal I remember, then I pulled you in for a strong hug.. The date was amazing. It was so good that I still blush thinking about it. The first peck I gave you on the cheek, I know the amount of nerves I needed for that. Our first Kiss? That is a story in itself. my first concern was how can I make her mine ompletely now, because I'll be damned if I let her go ever in my life. the second concern I had was that I need to control myself, because it was like the divine nectar, the combination of the world's best dishes, it felt like it was the thing that was missing from my life which I never noticed but now that it's there, I couldn't imagine my life without it. I needed more, beause want is a weak word for what I felt. I also needed to make sure I did not make you feel that I am only there for the physical thing. The lipstick after the first kiss was the least of my concerns. The rest of the date was beautiful as well, from MCdonalds to the book store to the subway. This was an adventure I only wish to do with you again, and I guess we are doing it again since this is given to you by december. Unless there were an mishaps in between and this was delivered early. </p>
